# K-means-Clustering-part-2

Perform K-Means clustering on the following dataset: ‘Wholesale customers data.csv’.


Steps to perform:
Following steps that are performed  in this project.
1 Explore the dataset
2 Import the required libraries  using  scikit-learn for K-Means: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html  .

3 Standardize the data using sklearn StandardScaler from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html  .

4 Fit the dataset on K-Means model.

5 Display the cluster centers and inertia for this technique.

6 Find the best k value by plotting the inertia vs number of clusters graph.

7 Using the best k value, perform predictions.
